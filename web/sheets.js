//   - The OAuth token is requested BY THE BROWSER (Google Identity Services
//     token client) and held in a variable in this closure. It is never
//     written to localStorage (XSS-stealable) and never sent to our server.
//   - Scope is drive.file: the narrowest that works. Google grants access
//     ONLY to files this app created — not the user's Drive. It also lets us
//     re-find our own spreadsheet via files.list if localStorage is wiped.
//   - Notes never transit our server and are never stored in our database.
//     The server's entire involvement is serving a public client id.
//
// The sheet is the EDITING surface; the site only displays. The app writes
// exactly one thing: its OWN columns (APP_HEADER, found by name in row 1) on
// rows whose problem is in your library, plus appending new such rows.
// Everything else in the spreadsheet is yours — the suggested note columns,
// any columns you add after them, any rows you add — and the app never
// writes, blanks, or deletes any of it.
// No cell has two writers, so there is nothing to merge, and no in-site
// editor means the token is only ever needed when YOU press sync.

// Exposed as ONE namespace (bottom of file) rather than bare globals: app.js
// calls these as cosineSheets.foo(), which also keeps the bundle lint honest —
// it checks bare calls per file, and a namespace makes the boundary explicit.
