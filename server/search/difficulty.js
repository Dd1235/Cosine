// Per-judge difficulty filtering.
//
// There is no cross-judge difficulty scale and this deliberately does not
// invent one. LeetCode has three named tiers, Codeforces has contest ratings,
// AtCoder has community-estimated ratings on a different distribution (they go
// negative), and CSES has independently reviewed estimated bands. Mapping those onto shared
// buckets would mean asserting a CF 1600 is "the same as" a LeetCode Medium,
// which nobody can defend. So a selection belongs to exactly one judge, and the
// UI only offers a judge's control when that judge is selected.
//
// Two kinds of selection, because the two kinds of scale differ in kind:
//
//   named   `lc-medium`      — a tier. LeetCode has three, and that's the whole
//                              vocabulary; a range would be meaningless.
//   range   `cf:1500-1700`   — a rating window, inclusive both ends. Codeforces
//                              ratings are all multiples of 100, so a step-100
//                              range expresses "exactly 1500" as `cf:1500-1500`.
//                              Fixed coarse bands could not.
//   accept  `ac:20-35`       — LeetCode acceptance rate, which is what makes a
//                              tier finer than three buckets. Composes WITH a
//                              tier rather than replacing it, so "the hardest
//                              Mediums" is `lc-medium,ac:13-30`.
//
// Acceptance rate is deliberately a filter and a within-tier tiebreak only,
// never a scale of its own. On the full LeetCode problemset it does track the
// tier boundary (median Medium 57.5%, Hard 47.3%, AUC 0.677), but on OUR slice
// that inverts — 554 of 661 served Mediums were selected BECAUSE they had the
// lowest acceptance rates, while every Hard came in unfiltered. So ordering a
// 15% Medium above a 60% Hard would report how the corpus was built, not how
// hard the problems are. Inside one tier that bias is gone and the number is
// simply the number.
//
// Both forms live in one `difficulty=` parameter and are self-identifying, so a
// URL needs no separate judge parameter to be interpreted against.

// refuses to sort unless exactly one judge is in play and that judge has a
// scale — the caller is told why rather than silently getting relevance order
// back.
//
// The harder question is what sorting does to paging, and the answer differs by
// view because it depends on whether there is any relevance to protect:
//
//   search (a query)  ranking IS the answer, so sorting the whole match set
//                     would throw it away. Sort the top N by relevance instead
//                     — "the easiest of the best matches" — and drop paging,
//                     because page 2 of a re-sorted top-N is meaningless.
//   browse / library  no query, so nothing is ranked and corpus order carries
//                     no meaning. Sort everything; paging stays coherent.
