// Turn a user's own judge stats into a difficulty selection.
//
// Every judge gets its OWN heuristic against its OWN scale. Nothing here maps
// a Codeforces rating onto AtCoder or LeetCode — that is the cross-judge
// normalization this project keeps refusing to invent, and it would be worse
// here than anywhere else, because a wrong guess about someone's level is a
// page of problems they can't attempt.
//
//   codeforces  rating R -> [R, R+200] on the 100-grid.
//               Codeforces ratings are calibrated so that a contestant rated R
//               solves a problem rated R about half the time under contest
//               conditions. So the band starts AT the user's rating (winnable,
//               not free) and reaches one notch past it. Below R is revision,
//               far above is a wall.
//
//   atcoder     rating R -> [R, R+200] on the 200-grid. The same reasoning
//               applies natively: AtCoder's community difficulty estimates are
//               "the rating at which 50% solve it", and we compare an AtCoder
//               rating against AtCoder difficulties. Same scale, no conversion.
//
//   leetcode    no rating exists, so this is the one real heuristic. LeetCode
//               publishes solved counts per tier, and those counts include the
//               whole problemset — most of which is easier than anything in
//               this corpus. So it is a coarse proxy and is treated as one: it
//               picks a tier, then an acceptance-rate half within that tier,
//               from the corpus's own median rather than invented cut-offs.
//
// Every suggestion carries the count it would produce, so the caller can say
// "214 problems" instead of applying a filter that might select nothing.
