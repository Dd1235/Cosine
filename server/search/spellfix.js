//
// `djikstra` and `kruskals` returned literally nothing: the vocabulary guard in
// routes/search.js correctly identified them as words no problem contains, and
// then said so. Which is honest, and useless — the user knows what they meant.
//
// The rule that makes this safe is that it only touches terms that are ALREADY
// contributing nothing. A token absent from the corpus vocabulary scores zero
// in BM25 and pulls the dense vector toward noise; appending its nearest real
// neighbour cannot displace a match that exists, because there was no match.
// Known terms are never rewritten, so no working query can regress. That is
// also why this is append-only rather than a substitution: if the correction is
// wrong, the original token is still there and still contributing its nothing.
//
// Deliberately NOT a general fuzzy index. There is no trigram table and no
// per-term index — the scan is over the vocabulary only for tokens that failed
// the exact check, which on real traffic is close to never.
